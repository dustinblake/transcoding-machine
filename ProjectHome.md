Transcoding Machine will handle automatic conversion of TV show or movie videos to a format you specify. It will also attempt to pull show or movie metadata, including cover art, from popular sites on the internet. Once the transcoding is complete and the metadata has been applied it will add the video to iTunes.

This application is the spiritual successor to [videoengine](http://code.google.com/p/videoengine/) and provides a number of key features not previously available.

  * Automatically transcode videos that are put in a defined directory
  * Complete queue management
  * Download TV show information from TheTVDB
  * Downloads Movie information from TheMovieDB
  * Fully native OS X application written in Cocoa
  * Update tags on existing mp4 files from online sources
